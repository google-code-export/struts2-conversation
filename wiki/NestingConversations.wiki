Implementing nested conversations, or sub-flows, is fairly simple.

Nested conversations are achieved in one of two main ways:  inheritance and explicit declaration.

===Inheritance===
The conversation inheritance mechanism works like this:  conversations in a sub-class are sub-conversations.   Consider the two following Struts2 action classes:

{{{
@ConversationController
public class SuperController {

   public String beginSuper() {return "success";}
   public String someSuperAction() {return "success";}
   public String endSuper() {return "success";}

}
}}}

{{{
@ConversationController
public class SubController extends SuperController {

   public String beginSub() {return "success";}
   public String someActionSub() {return "success";}
   public String endSub() {return "success";}

}
}}}

In the above, all three of the "sub" conversation actions are members of both the
