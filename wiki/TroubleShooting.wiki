This page covers solutions to simple setup/detail issues that can be big headaches.  

----
== Dependencies ==

The plugin uses slf4j for logging.  Without having the slf4j jars in your WAR file, the plugin's classes cannot be loaded.

To download the API, go [http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/slf4j/slf4j-api/1.6.4/ here].

For Maven users, include this dependency:

{{{
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
   <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
   <version>1.6.4</version>
</dependency>
}}}

The API will also need an implementation.  I use log4j.

Download it [http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/slf4j/slf4j-log4j12/1.6.4/ here].

And for Maven:

{{{
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
   <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
   <version>1.6.4</version>
</dependency>
}}}

==Action Conversation Flow and Configuration==

Sometimes with a larger application, it may become difficult to keep track of and quickly trouble shoot the conversation-flow aspects of all the actions.  

The Conversation Config Browser is a simple to use drop-in extension to the [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.struts/struts2-config-browser-plugin/2.3.1.2 Struts2 Config Browser Plugin] that includes a tab for viewing the Conversation flow details of each action in the application at run-time.

The extension is available from the Downloads link above or though Maven with the following dependency:

{{{
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.googlecode.struts2-conversation</groupId>
   <artifactId>struts2-conversation-config-browser-extension</artifactId>
   <version>1.5.5</version>
</dependency>
}}}
