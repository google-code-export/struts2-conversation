===Planned Features===
  * Add a _maxInstances_ attribute to the _@BeginConversation_ annotation to allow finer-grained control and configuration.  _Planned version:  1.8.0_
  * Add OGNL expression evaluation support for the _maxIdleTimeMillis_ attribute of the _@BeginConversation_ annotation.  This will allow for dynamically setting the timeout of a conversation by, for instance, putting a _getTimeout()_ method in your action class and setting _maxIdleTimeMillis="${timeout}"_.  _Planned version:  1.8.0_
  * Add Spring/Hibernate session/transaction support to make it simple to bind a transaction to a conversation.  _Planned version:  1.9.0_


===Tentative Release Schedule===
  *  v1.8.0 - September 2012
  *  v1.9.0 - October 2012
